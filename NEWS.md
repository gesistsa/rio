If the file exists but the `which` sheet does not, the data are added as a new sheet to the existing workbook. (#156)

# rio 0.5.7

* Import of files with the ambiguous .dat extension, which are typically text-delimited files, are now passed to `data.table::fread()` with a message. Export to the format remains unsupported. (#98, #155)
* Added support for export to SAS XPORT format (via `haven::write_xpt()`). (#157)
* Switched default import package for SAS XPORT format to `haven::read_xpt()` with a `haven = FALSE` toggle restoring the previous default behavior using `foreign::read.xpt()`. (#157)

* New functions `characterize()` and `factorize()` provide methods for converting "labelled" variables (e.g., from Stata or SPSS) into character or factor variables using embedded metadata. This can also be useful for exporting a metadata-rich file format into a plain text file. (#153)

* Added an `rbind` argument to `import_list()`. (#149)
* Added a `setclass` argument to `import_list()`, ala the same in `import()`.
* Switched `requireNamespace()` calls to `quietly = TRUE`.

* Further fixes to .csv.gz import/export. (#146, h/t Trevor Davis)

# rio 0.4.25

* Remove unecessary **urltools** dependency.
* New function `import_list()` returns a list of data frames from a multi-object Excel Workbook, .Rdata file, zip directory, or HTML file. (#126, #129)

* Fixed a bug in import from remote URLs with incorrect file extensions.

# rio 0.3.16

* Added support for import from fixed-width format files via `readr::read_fwf()` with a specified `widths` argument. This may enable faster import of these types of files and provides a base-like interface for working with readr. (#48)

# rio 0.3.15

* Added support for import from and export to yaml. (#83)
* Fixed a bug when reading from an uncommented CSVY yaml header that contained single-line comments. (#84, h/t Tom Aldenberg)

# rio 0.3.14

* Diagnostic messages were cleaned up to facilitate translation. (#57)

# rio 0.3.12

# rio 0.3.11

* `import()` now uses xml2 to read XML structures and `export()` uses a custom method for writing to XML, thereby negating dependency on the XML package. (#67)
* Enhancements were made to import and export of CSVY to store attribute metadata as variable-level attributes (like imports from binary file formats).
* `import()` gains a `which` argument that is used to select which file to return from within a compressed tar or zip archive.
* Export to tar now tries to correct for bugs in `tar()` that are being fixed in base R via [PR#16716](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16716).

# rio 0.3.10

* Fixed a bug in `import()` (introduced in #62, 7a7480e5) that prevented import from clipboard. (h/t Kevin Wright)
* `export()` returns a character string. (#82)

# rio 0.3.9

* The use of `import()` for SAS, Stata, and SPSS files has been streamlined. Regardless of whether the `haven = TRUE` argument is used, the data.frame returned by `import()` should now be (nearly) identical, with all attributes stored at the variable rather than data.frame level. This is a non-backwards compatible change. (#80)

# rio 0.3.8

* Fixed error in export to CSVY with a commented yaml header. (#81, h/t Andrew MacDonald)

# rio 0.3.7

* `export()` now allows automatic file compression as tar, gzip, or zip using the `file` argument (e.g., `export(iris, "iris.csv.zip")`).

# rio 0.3.6

* Expanded verbosity of `export()` for fixed-width format files and added a commented header containing column class and width information.
* Exporting factors to fixed-width format now saves those values as integer rather than numeric.
* Expanded test suite and separated tests into format-specific files. (#51)

# rio 0.3.5

* Export of CSVY files now includes commenting the yaml header by default. Import of CSVY accommodates this automatically. (#74)

# rio 0.3.3

* Export of CSVY files and metadata now supported by `export()`. (#73)
* Import of CSVY files now stores dataset-level metadata in attributes of the output data.frame. (#73, h/t Tom Aldenberg)
* When rio receives an unrecognized file format, it now issues a message. The new internal `.import.default()` and `.export.default()` then produce an error. This enables add-on packages to support additional formats through new s3 methods of the form `.import.rio_EXTENSION()` and `.export.rio_EXTENSION()`.

# rio 0.3.2

* Use S3 dispatch internally to call new (unexported) `.import()` and `.export()` methods. (#42, h/t Jason Becker)

# rio 0.3.0

* Release to CRAN.
* Set a default numerical precision (of 2 decimal places) for export to fixed-width format.

# rio 0.2.13

* Import stats package for `na.omit()`.

# rio 0.2.11

* Added support for direct import from Google Sheets. (#60, #63, h/t Chung-hong Chan)

# rio 0.2.7

* Refactored remote file retrieval into separate (non-exported) function used by `import()`. (#62)
* Added test sutie to test file conversion.
* Expanded test suite to include test of all export formats.

# rio 0.2.6

* Cleaned up NAMESPACE file.

# rio 0.2.5

* If file format for a remote file cannot be identified from the supplied URL or the final URL reported by `curl::curl_fetch_memory()`, the HTTP headers are checked for a filename in the Content-Disposition header. (#36)
* Removed longurl dependency. This is no longer needed because we can identify formats using curl's url argument.
* Fixed a bug related to importing European-style ("csv2") format files. (#44)
* Updated CSVY import to embed variable-level metadata. (#52)
* Use `urltools::url_parse()` to extract file extensions from complex URLs (e.g., those with query arguments). (#56)
* Fixed NAMESPACE notes for base packages. (#58)

# rio 0.2.4

* Modified behavior so that files imported using haven now store variable metadata at the data.frame level by default (unlike the default behavior in haven, which can cause problems). (#37, h/t Ista Zahn)
* Added support for importing CSVY (http://csvy.org/) formatted files. (#52)
* Added import dependency on data.table 1.9.5. (#39)

# rio 0.2.2

* Uses the longurl package to expand shortened URLs so that their file type can be easily determined.

# rio 0.2.1

* Improved support for importing from compressed directories, especially web-based compressed directories. (#38)
* Add import dependency on curl >= 0.6 to facilitate content type parsing and format inference from URL redirects. (#36)
* Add bit64 to `Suggests` to remove an `import` warning.

# rio 0.2

* Added support for export to simple XML documents. (#12)
* Added support for import from simple XML documents via `XML::xmlToDataFrame`. (#12)
* Added support for import from ODS spreadsheet formats. (#12, h/t Chung-hong Chan)
* Use `data.table::fread` by default for reading delimited files. (#3)
* Added support for import and export of `dput` and `dget` objects. (#10)
* Added support for reading from compressed archives (.zip and .tar). (#7)
* Added support for writing to fixed-width format. (#8)
* Set `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` as default for reading tabular data. (#4)
* Added support for HTTPS imports. (#1, h/t Christopher Gandrud)
* Added support for automatic file naming in `export` based on object name and file format. (#5)
* Exposed `convert` function.
* Added vignette, knitr-generated README.md, and updated documentation. (#2)
* Added some non-exported functions to simplify argument passing and streamline package API. (#6)
* Separated `import`, `export`, `convert`, and utilities into separate source code files.
* Expanded the set of supported file types/extensions, switched SPSS, SAS, and Stata formats to **haven**, making its use optional.
