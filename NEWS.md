# CHANGES TO v0.5.8

 * Export the `get_ext()` function. (#169)

# CHANGES TO v0.5.7

 * Import of files with the ambiguous .dat extension, which are typically text-delimited files, are now passed to `data.table::fread()` with a message. Export to the format remains unsupported. (#98, #155)
 * Added support for export to SAS XPORT format (via `haven::write_xpt()`). (#157)
 * Switched default import package for SAS XPORT format to `haven::read_xpt()` with a `haven = FALSE` toggle restoring the previous default behavior using `foreign::read.xpt()`. (#157)

 * `import_list()` now returns a `NULL` entry for any failed imports, with a warning. (#149)
 * `import_list()` gains additional arguments `rbind_fill` and `rbind_label` to control rbind-ing behavior. (#149)

# CHANGES TO v0.4.27

 * Import to and export from the clipboard now relies on `clipr::read_clip()` and `clipr::write_clip()`, respectively, thus (finally) providing Linux support. (#105, h/t Matthew Lincoln)
 * Added an `rbind` argument to `import_list()`. (#149)
 * Added a `setclass` argument to `import_list()`, ala the same in `import()`.
 * Switched `requireNamespace()` calls to `quietly = TRUE`.

# CHANGES TO v0.4.26

 * Further fixes to .csv.gz import/export. (#146, h/t Trevor Davis)

# CHANGES TO v0.4.25

 * Remove unecessary **urltools** dependency.
 * New function `import_list()` returns a list of data frames from a multi-object Excel Workbook, .Rdata file, zip directory, or HTML file. (#126, #129)

# CHANGES TO v0.3.14

 * Diagnostic messages were cleaned up to facilitate translation. (#57)

# CHANGES TO v0.3.12

# CHANGES TO v0.3.11

 * `import()` now uses xml2 to read XML structures and `export()` uses a custom method for writing to XML, thereby negating dependency on the XML package. (#67)
 * Enhancements were made to import and export of CSVY to store attribute metadata as variable-level attributes (like imports from binary file formats).
 * `import()` gains a `which` argument that is used to select which file to return from within a compressed tar or zip archive.
 * Export to tar now tries to correct for bugs in `tar()` that are being fixed in base R via [PR#16716](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16716).

# CHANGES TO v0.3.10

 * Fixed a bug in `import()` (introduced in #62, 7a7480e5) that prevented import from clipboard. (h/t Kevin Wright)
 * `export()` returns a character string. (#82)

# CHANGES TO v0.3.9

 * The use of `import()` for SAS, Stata, and SPSS files has been streamlined. Regardless of whether the `haven = TRUE` argument is used, the data.frame returned by `import()` should now be (nearly) identical, with all attributes stored at the variable rather than data.frame level. This is a non-backwards compatible change. (#80)

# CHANGES TO v0.3.8

 * Fixed error in export to CSVY with a commented yaml header. (#81, h/t Andrew MacDonald)

# CHANGES TO v0.3.7

 * `export()` now allows automatic file compression as tar, gzip, or zip using the `file` argument (e.g., `export(iris, "iris.csv.zip")`).

# CHANGES TO v0.3.6

 * Expanded verbosity of `export()` for fixed-width format files and added a commented header containing column class and width information.
 * Exporting factors to fixed-width format now saves those values as integer rather than numeric.
 * Expanded test suite and separated tests into format-specific files. (#51)

# CHANGES TO v0.3.5

 * Export of CSVY files now includes commenting the yaml header by default. Import of CSVY accommodates this automatically. (#74)

# CHANGES TO v0.3.3

 * Export of CSVY files and metadata now supported by `export()`. (#73)
 * Import of CSVY files now stores dataset-level metadata in attributes of the output data.frame. (#73, h/t Tom Aldenberg)
 * When rio receives an unrecognized file format, it now issues a message. The new internal `.import.default()` and `.export.default()` then produce an error. This enables add-on packages to support additional formats through new s3 methods of the form `.import.rio_EXTENSION()` and `.export.rio_EXTENSION()`.

# CHANGES TO v0.3.2

 * Use S3 dispatch internally to call new (unexported) `.import()` and `.export()` methods. (#42, h/t Jason Becker)

# CHANGES TO v0.3.0

 * Release to CRAN.
 * Set a default numerical precision (of 2 decimal places) for export to fixed-width format.

# CHANGES TO v0.2.13

 * Import stats package for `na.omit()`.

# CHANGES TO v0.2.11

 * Added support for direct import from Google Sheets. (#60, #63, h/t Chung-hong Chan)

# CHANGES TO v0.2.7

 * Refactored remote file retrieval into separate (non-exported) function used by `import()`. (#62)
 * Added test sutie to test file conversion.
 * Expanded test suite to include test of all export formats.

# CHANGES TO v0.2.6

 * Cleaned up NAMESPACE file.

# CHANGES TO v0.2.5

 * If file format for a remote file cannot be identified from the supplied URL or the final URL reported by `curl::curl_fetch_memory()`, the HTTP headers are checked for a filename in the Content-Disposition header. (#36)
 * Removed longurl dependency. This is no longer needed because we can identify formats using curl's url argument.
 * Fixed a bug related to importing European-style ("csv2") format files. (#44)
 * Updated CSVY import to embed variable-level metadata. (#52)
 * Use `urltools::url_parse()` to extract file extensions from complex URLs (e.g., those with query arguments). (#56)
 * Fixed NAMESPACE notes for base packages. (#58)

# CHANGES TO v0.2.4

 * Modified behavior so that files imported using haven now store variable metadata at the data.frame level by default (unlike the default behavior in haven, which can cause problems). (#37, h/t Ista Zahn)
 * Added support for importing CSVY (http://csvy.org/) formatted files. (#52)
 * Added import dependency on data.table 1.9.5. (#39)

# CHANGES TO v0.2.2

 * Uses the longurl package to expand shortened URLs so that their file type can be easily determined.

# CHANGES TO v0.2.1

 * Improved support for importing from compressed directories, especially web-based compressed directories. (#38)
 * Add import dependency on curl >= 0.6 to facilitate content type parsing and format inference from URL redirects. (#36)
 * Add bit64 to `Suggests` to remove an `import` warning.

# CHANGES TO v0.2

 * Added support for import from legacy Excel (.xls) files `readxl::read_excel`, making its use optional. (#19)
 * Added support for import from and export to the system clipboard on Windows and Mac OS.
 * Added support for export to simple XML documents. (#12)
 * Added support for import from simple XML documents via `XML::xmlToDataFrame`. (#12)
 * Added support for import from ODS spreadsheet formats. (#12, h/t Chung-hong Chan)
 * Use `data.table::fread` by default for reading delimited files. (#3)
 * Added support for import and export of `dput` and `dget` objects. (#10)
 * Added support for reading from compressed archives (.zip and .tar). (#7)
 * Added support for writing to fixed-width format. (#8)
 * Set `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` as default for reading tabular data. (#4)
 * Added support for HTTPS imports. (#1, h/t Christopher Gandrud)
 * Added support for automatic file naming in `export` based on object name and file format. (#5)
 * Exposed `convert` function.
 * Added vignette, knitr-generated README.md, and updated documentation. (#2)
 * Added some non-exported functions to simplify argument passing and streamline package API. (#6)
 * Separated `import`, `export`, `convert`, and utilities into separate source code files.
 * Expanded the set of supported file types/extensions, switched SPSS, SAS, and Stata formats to **haven**, making its use optional.

 * Updated documentation and fixed a bug in csv import without header.

# CHANGES TO v0.1.1

 * Initial release
