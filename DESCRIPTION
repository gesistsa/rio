Description: Rio is a set of tools aims to simplify the process of
    importing/exporting data. The import() and export() functions will
    determine data file format base on the file extension, without the need to
    select appropriate read/write function for the specific data file format.
    For example, exporting the iris data into a csv file can be achieved with
    the following command: export(iris, "iris.csv")
Depends:
