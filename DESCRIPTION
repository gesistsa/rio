Description: Streamlined data import and export by making assumptions that the user is probably willing to make: 'import()' and 'export()' determine the data structure from the file extension, reasonable defaults are used for data import and export (e.g., 'stringsAsFactors=FALSE'), web-based import is natively supported (including from SSL/HTTPS), compressed files can be read directly without explicit decompression, and fast import packages are used where appropriate.
