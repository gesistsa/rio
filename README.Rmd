# rio: A Swiss-Army Knife for Data I/O

The aim of **rio** is to make data file I/O in R as easy as possible by implementing three simple functions in Swiss-army knife style:

 - `export()` and `import()` provide a painless data I/O experience by automatically choosing the appropriate data read or write function based on file extension
 - `import_list()` imports a list of data frames from a multi-object file (Excel workbook, .Rdata files, zip directory, or HTML file)
 - `convert()` wraps `import()` and `export()` to allow the user to easily convert between file formats (thus providing a FOSS replacement for programs like [Stat/Transfer](https://www.stattransfer.com/) or [Sledgehammer](https://www.mtna.us/#/products/sledgehammer)). [Luca Braglia](https://lbraglia.github.io/) has created a Shiny app called [rioweb](https://github.com/lbraglia/rioweb) that provides access to the file conversion features of rio. [GREA](https://github.com/Stan125/GREA/) is an RStudio add-in that provides an interactive interface for reading in data using rio.

## Examples

Because **rio** is meant to streamline data I/O, the package is extremely easy to use. Here are some examples of reading, writing, and converting data files.

### Export

Exporting data is handled with one function, `export()`:

```{r}
library("rio")

export(mtcars, "mtcars.csv") # comma-separated values
export(mtcars, "mtcars.rds") # R serialized
export(mtcars, "mtcars.sav") # SPSS
```

A particularly useful feature of rio is the ability to import from and export to compressed (e.g., zip) directories, saving users the extra step of compressing a large exported file, e.g.:

```{r}
export(mtcars, "mtcars.tsv.zip")
```

As of rio v0.5.0, `export()` can also write multiple data farmes to respective sheets of an Excel workbook or an HTML file:

```{r}
export(list(mtcars = mtcars, iris = iris), file = "mtcars.xlsx")
```

### Import

Importing data is handled with one function, `import()`:

```{r}
x <- import("mtcars.csv")
y <- import("mtcars.rds")
z <- import("mtcars.sav")

# confirm data match
all.equal(x, y, check.attributes = FALSE)
all.equal(x, z, check.attributes = FALSE)
```

Note: Because of inconsistencies across underlying packages, the data.frame returned by `import` might vary slightly (in variable classes and attributes) depending on file type.

In rio v0.5.0, a new list-based import function was added. This allows users to import a list of data frames from a multi-object file (such as an Excel workbook, .Rdata file, zip directory, or HTML file):

```{r}
str(import_list("mtcars.xlsx"))
```

### Convert

The `convert()` function links `import()` and `export()` by constructing a dataframe from the imported file and immediately writing it back to disk. `convert()` invisibly returns the file name of the exported file, so that it can be used to programmatically access the new file.

```{r}
convert("mtcars.sav", "mtcars.dta")
```

It is also possible to use **rio** on the command-line by calling `Rscript` with the `-e` (expression) argument. For example, to convert a file from Stata (.dta) to comma-separated values (.csv), simply do the following:

```
Rscript -e "rio::convert('iris.dta', 'iris.csv')"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
unlink("mtcars.csv")
unlink("mtcars.dta")
unlink("mtcars.sav")
unlink("mtcars.rds")
unlink("mtcars.xlsx")
unlink("mtcars.tsv.zip")
```

## Supported file formats

**rio** supports a variety of different file formats for import and export. To keep the package slim, all non-essential formats are supported via "Suggests" packages, which are not installed (or loaded) by default. To ensure rio is fully functional, install these packages the first time you use **rio** via:

```R
install_formats()
```

The full list of supported formats is below:

| Format | Import | Export |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Tab-separated data (.tsv) | Yes | Yes |
| Comma-separated data (.csv) | Yes | Yes |
| gzip comma-separated data (.csv.gz) | Yes | Yes |
| CSVY (CSV + YAML metadata header) (.csvy) | Yes | Yes |
| Feather R/Python interchange format (.feather) | Yes | Yes |
| Fast Storage (.fst) | Yes | Yes |
| Pipe-separated data (.psv) | Yes | Yes |
| Fixed-width format data (.fwf) | Yes | Yes |
| Serialized R objects (.rds) | Yes | Yes |
| Saved R objects (.RData,.rda) | Yes | Yes |
| JSON (.json) | Yes | Yes |
| YAML (.yml) | Yes | Yes |
| Stata (.dta) | Yes | Yes |
| SPSS (.sav) | Yes | Yes |
| SPSS Portable (.por) | Yes |  |
| "XBASE" database files (.dbf) | Yes | Yes |
| Excel (.xls) | Yes |  |
| Excel (.xlsx) | Yes | Yes |
| Matlab (.mat) | Yes | Yes |
| OpenDocument Spreadsheet  (.ods) | Yes | Yes |
| Weka Attribute-Relation File Format (.arff) | Yes | Yes |
| R syntax (.R) | Yes | Yes |
| Shallow XML documents (.xml) | Yes | Yes |
| HTML Tables (.html) | Yes | Yes |
| SAS (.sas7bdat) | Yes | Yes |
| SAS XPORT (.xpt) | Yes |  |
| Minitab (.mtp) | Yes |  |
| Epiinfo (.rec) | Yes |  |
| Systat (.syd) | Yes |  |
| Data Interchange Format (.dif) | Yes |  |
| Fortran data (no recognized extension) | Yes |  |
| [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) | Yes |  |
| Clipboard (default is tsv) | Yes (Mac and Windows) | Yes (Mac and Windows) |

Additionally, any format that is not supported by **rio** but that has a known R implementation will produce an informative error message pointing to a package and import or export function. Unrecognized formats will yield a simple "Unrecognized file format" error.

## Package Philosophy

The core advantage of **rio** is that it makes assumptions that the user is probably willing to make. Eight of these are important:

 1. **rio** uses the file extension of a file name to determine what kind of file it is. This is the same logic used by Windows OS, for example, in determining what application is associated with a given file type. By taking away the need to manually match a file type (which a beginner may not recognize) to a particular import or export function, **rio** allows almost all common data formats to be read with the same function. Other packages do this as well, but **rio** aims to be more complete and more consistent than each:
 
   - [**reader**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=reader) handles certain text formats and R binary files
   - [**io**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=io) offers a set of custom formats
   - [**ImportExport**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ImportExport) focuses on select binary formats (Excel, SPSS, and Access files) and provides a Shiny interface.
   - [**SchemaOnRead**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SchemaOnRead) iterates through a large number of possible import methods until one works successfully
   
 2. **rio** uses `data.table::fread()` for text-delimited files to automatically determine the file format regardless of the extension. So, a CSV that is actually tab-separated will still be correctly imported. It's also crazy fast.
 
 3. **rio**, wherever possible, does not import character strings as factors.
 
 4. **rio** stores metadata from rich file formats (SPSS, Stata, etc.) in variable-level attributes in a consistent form regardless of file type or underlying import function. The `gather_attrs()` function makes it easy to move variable-level attributes to the data frame level.
 
 5. **rio** supports web-based imports natively, including from SSL (HTTPS) URLs, from shortened URLs, from URLs that lack proper extensions, and from (public) Google Documents Spreadsheets.
 
 6. **rio** imports from from single-file .zip and .tar archives automatically, without the need to explicitly decompress them. Export to compressed directories is also supported.
 
 7. **rio** imports and exports files based on an internal S3 class infrastructure. This means that other packages can contain extensions to **rio** by registering S3 methods. These methods should take the form `.import.rio_X()` and `.export.rio_X()`, where `X` is the file extension of a file type. An example is provided in the [rio.db package](https://github.com/leeper/rio.db).
 
 8. **rio** wraps a variety of faster, more stream-lined I/O packages than those provided by base R or the **foreign** package. It uses [**haven**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=haven) for reading and writing SAS, Stata, and SPSS files, [the `fread` function from **data.table**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table) for delimited formats, smarter and faster fixed-width file import and export routines, and [**readxl**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=readxl) for reading from Excel workbooks.

## Package Installation

The package is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rio) and can be installed directly in R using `install.packages()`. You may want to run `install_formats()` after the first installation.

```R
install.packages("rio")
install_formats()
```

The latest development version on GitHub can be installed using [**ghit**](https://github.com/cloudyr/ghit), a lightweight alternative to `devtools::install_github()`:

```R
if(!require("ghit")){
    install.packages("ghit")
}
ghit::install_github("leeper/rio")
```

Because of how **ghit** handles Suggests packages, you do not need to run `install_formats()` when installing directly from GitHub.
