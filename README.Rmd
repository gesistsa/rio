## Overview

The aim of **rio** is to make data file I/O in R as easy as possible by implementing two main functions in Swiss-army knife style:

 - `import()` provides a painless data import experience by automatically choosing the appropriate import/read function based on file extension (or a specified `format` argument)
 - `export()` provides the same painless file recognition for data export/write functionality

## Installation

The package is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rio) and can be installed directly in R using `install.packages()`.

```R
install.packages("rio")
```

The latest development version on GitHub can be installed using:

```R
if (!require("remotes")){
    install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("gesistsa/rio")
```

Optional: Installation of additional formats (see below: **Supported file formats**)

```R
library(rio)
install_formats()
```

## Usage

Because **rio** is meant to streamline data I/O, the package is extremely easy to use. Here are some examples of reading, writing, and converting data files.

### Import

Importing data is handled with one function, `import()`:

```{r import1}
library("rio")
import("starwars.xlsx")
```

```{r import2}
import("starwars.csv")
```

Note: Because of inconsistencies across underlying packages, the data.frame returned by `import` might vary slightly (in variable classes and attributes) depending on file type.

### Export

Exporting data is handled with one function, `export()`:

```{r exports}
export(mtcars, "mtcars.csv") # comma-separated values
export(mtcars, "mtcars.rds") # R serialized
export(mtcars, "mtcars.sav") # SPSS
```

A particularly useful feature of rio is the ability to import from and export to compressed (e.g., zip) directories, saving users the extra step of compressing a large exported file, e.g.:

```{r export_zip}
export(mtcars, "mtcars.tsv.zip")
```

`export()` can also write multiple data frames to respective sheets of an Excel workbook or an HTML file:

```{r export_a_list}
export(list(mtcars = mtcars, iris = iris), file = "mtcars.xlsx")
```

## Supported file formats

**rio** supports a wide range of file formats. To keep the package slim, several formats are supported via "Suggests" packages, which are not installed (or loaded) by default. To ensure rio is fully functional, install these packages the first time you use **rio** via:

```R
install_formats()
```

The full list of supported formats is below:

Additionally, any format that is not supported by **rio** but that has a known R implementation will produce an informative error message pointing to a package and import or export function. Unrecognized formats will yield a simple "Unrecognized file format" error.

## Other functions

### Convert

The `convert()` function links `import()` and `export()` by constructing a dataframe from the imported file and immediately writing it back to disk. `convert()` invisibly returns the file name of the exported file, so that it can be used to programmatically access the new file.

```{r convert}
convert("mtcars.sav", "mtcars.dta")
```

It is also possible to use **rio** on the command-line by calling `Rscript` with the `-e` (expression) argument. For example, to convert a file from Stata (.dta) to comma-separated values (.csv), simply do the following:

```
Rscript -e "rio::convert('iris.dta', 'iris.csv')"
```

### *_list

`import_list()` allows users to import a list of data frames from a multi-object file (such as an Excel workbook, .Rdata file, zip directory, or HTML file):

```{r import_list}
str(m <- import_list("mtcars.xlsx"))
```

`export_list()` makes it easy to export a list of (possibly named) data frames to multiple files:

```{r export_list}
export_list(m, "%s.tsv")
c("mtcars.tsv", "iris.tsv") %in% dir()
```

```{r cleanup, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
unlink("mtcars.csv")
unlink("mtcars.dta")
unlink("mtcars.sav")
unlink("mtcars.rds")
unlink("mtcars.xlsx")
unlink("mtcars.tsv.zip")
unlink("mtcars.tsv")
unlink("iris.tsv")
```

## Package Philosophy

The core advantage of **rio** is that it makes assumptions that the user is probably willing to make. Eight of these are important:

 1. **rio** uses the file extension of a file name to determine what kind of file it is. This is the same logic used by Windows OS, for example, in determining what application is associated with a given file type. By removing the need to manually match a file type (which a beginner may not recognize) to a particular import or export function, **rio** allows almost all common data formats to be read with the same function. And if a file extension is incorrect, users can force a particular import method by specifying the `format` argument.

 2. **rio** uses `data.table::fread()` for text-delimited files to automatically determine the file format regardless of the extension. So, a CSV that is actually tab-separated will still be correctly imported. It's also crazy fast.

 3. **rio**, wherever possible, does not import character strings as factors.

 4. **rio** supports web-based imports natively, including from SSL (HTTPS) URLs, from shortened URLs, from URLs that lack proper extensions, and from (public) Google Documents Spreadsheets.

 5. **rio** imports from from single-file .zip and .tar archives automatically, without the need to explicitly decompress them. Export to compressed directories is also supported.

 6. **rio** wraps a variety of faster, more stream-lined I/O packages than those provided by base R or the **foreign** package. It uses [**data.table**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table) for delimited formats, [**haven**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=haven) for SAS, Stata, and SPSS files, smarter and faster fixed-width file import and export routines, and [**readxl**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=readxl) and [**openxlsx**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=openxlsx) for reading and writing Excel workbooks.

 7. **rio** stores metadata from rich file formats (SPSS, Stata, etc.) in variable-level attributes in a consistent form regardless of file type or underlying import function. These attributes are identified as:

     - `label`: a description of variable
     - `labels`: a vector mapping numeric values to character strings those values represent
     - `format`: a character string describing the variable storage type in the original file

      The `gather_attrs()` function makes it easy to move variable-level attributes to the data frame level (and `spread_attrs()` reverses that gathering process). These can be useful, especially, during file conversion to more easily modify attributes that are handled differently across file formats. As an example, the following idiom can be used to trim SPSS value labels to the 32-character maximum allowed by Stata:

      ```R
      dat <- gather_attrs(rio::import("data.sav"))
      attr(dat, "labels") <- lapply(attributes(dat)$labels, function(x) {
          if (!is.null(x)) {
              names(x) <- substring(names(x), 1, 32)
          }
          x
      })
      export(spread_attrs(dat), "data.dta")
      ```

      In addition, two functions (added in v0.5.5) provide easy ways to create character and factor variables from these "labels" attributes. `characterize()` converts a single variable or all variables in a data frame that have "labels" attributes into character vectors based on the mapping of values to value labels. `factorize()` does the same but returns factor variables. This can be especially helpful for converting these rich file formats into open formats (e.g., `export(characterize(import("file.dta")), "file.csv")`.

 8. **rio** imports and exports files based on an internal S3 class infrastructure. This means that other packages can contain extensions to **rio** by registering S3 methods. These methods should take the form `.import.rio_X()` and `.export.rio_X()`, where `X` is the file extension of a file type. An example is provided in the [rio.db package](https://github.com/leeper/rio.db).
